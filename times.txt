-----Pytesseract OCR (no gpu used, external software needed, GUI Off)

Total OCR fails: 332 out of 1802
Finished in 286.66 seconds

conclusion: EasyOCR is much more accurate, and take much less time if you have a GPU. 
Possibly much more time off if you have a higher powered GPU. Having GUI on barely makes a difference.
